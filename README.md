Native Android App for touristic routes management.

Abstract

The general goal of this project focuses on the development of an
application that allows the creation and management of touristic routes by
selecting points of interest that the user can track based on previously detailed
search parameters as well as a later configuration of the route itself prior to its
viewing.
Likewise, the application offers the option of saving those same routes for
later viewing, as well as editing and deleting them.
